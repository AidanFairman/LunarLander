# Welcome to my Lunar Lander project

### Summary
This game was written in XNA/MonoGame using vector-based graphics.

To play the game, players use the left and right buttons to rotate CCW or CW, and hold space to fire the thrusters.
Players must land upright on the green pads at a slow enough rate to not be destroyed on impact. The only enemy is gravity and the skills of the player. Just make sure you don't run out of fuel...

There is a runnable executable in the Runnable folder. It does require the surrounding files to run, so please download the entire 'Runnable' folder, found [here](https://github.com/AidanFairman/LunarLander/tree/master/Runnable)
